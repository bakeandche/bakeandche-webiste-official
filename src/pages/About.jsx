            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              In Westminster, California, there's a cozy spot called Bake & Che. It's not your average dessert shop; 
              it's a dream come true for Co Huong, a woman with a passion for food and heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally from Vietnam, Co Huong brought her love for Vietnamese desserts to California. She wanted 
              to share her culture's flavors with her new community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bake & Che opened in 2023, bringing the tastes of Vietnam to Westminster. Using fresh, local ingredients, 
              Co Huong ensures each treat is made with traditional flavor.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes Bake & Che special is its blend of tradition and innovation. Co Huong adapts recipes to suit 
              modern tastes while still honoring her roots.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, Bake & Che expanded to Garden Grove, showing its growing popularity. It's not just a dessert shop; 
              it's a celebration of culture and a reminder of the joy food can bring.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, come on over to Bake & Che, and let your taste buds take a trip to Vietnam, one bite at a time.
